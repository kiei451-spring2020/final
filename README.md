In the near future, when vehicles are fully autonomous, I want to create a 'community ride' program that allows vehicle owners
to allow senior members of the community to request 'rides' during the weekend when the vehicle is not in use. 
This will enable the older generation to visit places such as the farmer's market, local library, summer festivals, etc. without
having to rely on other modes of public transportation.
